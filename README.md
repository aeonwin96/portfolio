## Description
My name is Aeon Huynh, this website is my Technical writing/documentation portfolio.

## Requirements
The basic frame work of this page was created with a [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com). template. As the name implies, the bulk of that framework is modified Bootstrap.

I've modified parts of the Bootstrap template, css, html, and js to fit my needs and make the site more friendly for a particular audience.

The Start Bootstrap template was very well labeled and easy to navigate, and I tried to preserve the same organizational styles in their code whenever I made changes that could disrupt that order.

Feel free to look around, thanks for stopping by!
